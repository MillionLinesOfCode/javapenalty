# javapenalty
A simple football penalty shootout game written in the Java programming language.

# How it works
1.Select your favourite player from a list of five players.

2.Select a goalkeeper from a list of five keepers.

3.Choose where you want to shoot the ball.
 _A number (between 1 and 6) is randomly generated to determine where the keeper will dive._

4.If the goalkeeper guesses it right he saves the shot, else you score!

5.The player will get a total of 5 chances to score(or miss!).

# Installing

2.Download all the .java files and put them all in the same directory and then compile them using "javac *.java"

3.Proceed to run the AnimationApp.java file using "java AnimationApp" and try scoring some goals!.
