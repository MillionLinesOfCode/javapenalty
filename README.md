javapenalty: What is it?
A simple football penalty shootout game written in the Java programming language.

The user will choose their favourite football player, who takes the penalty, and the goalkeeper who attempts to save the shot from the user, both from a list of players. The goalkeeper will, however, not be playable.

The player will get 5 chances to score(or miss!).

Usage
To run the program, first switch to the Demo-1 branch.

Download all the .java files and put them all in the same directory.

Then compile them using "javac *.java"

Proceed to run the AnimationApp.java file using "java AnimationApp" and enjoy scoring goals!

NOTE:
This is a text based version of the final project which is intended to demonstrate the logic used and provides the user with a basic level of interaction.

A class diagram is provided for reference in both the Demo-1 branch and the master branch.
