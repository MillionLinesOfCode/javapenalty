# javapenalty: What is it?
A simple football penalty shootout game written in the Java programming language.

Select your favourite player from a list of five players.

Select a goalkeeper from a list of five keepers.

Choose where you want to shoot the ball.

A number (between 1 and 6) is randomly generated to determine where the keeper will dive.

If the goalkeeper guesses it right he saves the shot, else you score!

The player will get a total of 5 chances to score(or miss!).

# Usage
